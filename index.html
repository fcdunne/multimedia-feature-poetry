<h3> Rupi Kaur has reinvented the art form, but to who’s benefit? Sheffield’s leading poetry figures give their opinion. </h3>

            <p>In 2017, poetry made a breakthrough. Sales rose by 10% and a record breaking amount of poetry books were sold. Kate Tempest played at Glastonbury-poetry was cool. Yet the platform which may have contributed most to its heightened success was Instagram. In fact, a new breed of poets emerged: Instapoets.  </p>



            <p>No one adorns the term better than Rupi Kaur- an Instagram poet with over two million followers. Her debut poetry book ‘Milk and Honey’, released in 2015, reached the top spot of the New York Times bestsellers list and finished second place on Amazon’s best sellers of 2017. Her second collection ‘The Sun and Her Flowers’,released in October, is already set to replace herself on the 2018 league tables. Despite Kaur's commercial popularity, controversy surrounds her name in the more traditional poetry world. So, will the new year bring new heights of success for Instapoets or has their year been and gone?  </p>

<p>Three figures from Sheffield’s poetry scene give their opinion on what Instagram, and Instapoets, are doing to poetry.  </p>

            <p>Mark Greene is a Sheffield based poet. His work has been published in over 25 magazines internationally, including Now Then and Crannóg. Alongside commissions, he also publishes snippets of his work on his Instagram account, 'greenepoetlife'. Since 2016, when he began to use Instagram to publicise his poetry, he’s managed to captivate a sizeable following of almost 7,700 users. So, as a rising Instagram poet, what does he think about the platform? </p>

<p>“I used to use Instagram as my personal account but I came home after a night out once and scribbled down a load of nonsense and I put it on Instagram and I got a lot of likes. People from Switzerland and as far away as Brazil have got in touch with me about using my work.</p>

<p>Initially, I built my following through other users liking and sharing my work but I think more about how I can use it now. I’ll try and do about 30 hash tags and after I’ve put some up I’ll like other peoples’ posts. If people like you quite soon then you go to the home page, where you’re more likely to be seen by a wider audience. So, sometimes I’ll tag like ‘poetrygram’ or ‘bookstagram’ and when I’ve done that my posts have been in the top 9 posts on Instagram.</p>

<p>That’s more of the marketing side coming out. But in a couple of years’ time, when I want to sell my work to a publisher, it’s going to be a lot easier to sell it if I can show them that I have a big following, if I’ve got like ten to 15,000 people following me. </p>
<p>I will admit though that a lot of the stuff you see on Instagram, it’s like motivational words rather than actual poetry. Even the stuff I put up, I wouldn’t submit that to a poetry magazine. Rupi Kaur’s stuff, I wouldn’t actually class as poetry. It’s just a sentence broken down. Although I wouldn’t mind making the money she makes.  </p>

<p>I find on Instagram, you don’t want to put something up that people have to spend about half an hour figuring out. It’s more like ‘oh look at this poem. Read it. Like that. Next poem.’ Which I think Rupi Kaur is quite good at.  </p>
<p>I wouldn’t go and buy a magazine of all of the best Instagram anthologies but if people enjoy doing it than that’s all that really matters.”</p>

            <p>Verse Matters is a monthly poetry event in Sheffield which invites both professional and amateur poets to perform their pieces to an audience. Originally conceived by one woman, Rachel Bower, growing numbers of attendees have meant that there are now five individuals who run the events. Salomée Berangér is one of them. A writer and reader of poetry herself, what does Berangér think about Instagram as a platform for poetry? </p>
   <img class="circle wow fadeIn" src="images/Salomee.jpg" alt="" />
<p>“For Instagram, I think there needs to be a combination of illustrations and words. There are a lot of poets that post their words with illustrations and there are a lot of illustrators that use words as part of a bigger piece of art. It catches your attention. </P>
  <p>I follow quite a few poets on Instagram. I love Rupi Kaur. I like the fact that her stuff is really raw and really honest. Her stuff is so inspirational but minimalist at the same time, which played a big role in her getting so big. </P>
    <p>I know that a lot of people just think that Rupi Kaur just shares her work to make money but I would say to these people that they haven’t read the books. It’s fine what she shares on Instagram, but the books are much more. They’re about really deep issues that are really important, and true, and real. You feel that this person is writing from her gut and not just to appeal to people. She raises issues about rape and violence and her roots. </P>

      <p>But it depends what sort of poet you are as to whether Instagram works for you. If you’re a written poet and your work looks nice on the page, with doodles and words than it could be a good way of selling your stuff but I don’t think that could work with every poet. There are so many other ways to publicise poetry, like spoken word events, university slams, YouTube and more.”

          <P>Jess Timperley is an administrator for a Sheffield based independent poetry publisher, The Poetry Business. For over 30 years, The Poetry Business has been publishing poetry books, pamphlets and helping young writers develop. Amid both the traditional and social media focused, contemporary poetry worlds, does Timperley think that poetry benefits from the online platform?</p>
               <img class="circle wow fadeIn" src="images/Jess.jpg" alt="" />
            <p>“I personally think it’s great that people are getting more involved in poetry but I do think that all things on Instagram take a very posy and very fake outlook. You’ve got a filter on everything and that’s the whole point of Instagram basically. I think it’s great to spread awareness and to get more people involved in poetry but the people that I would consider to be real, up and coming poets, I don’t think use Instagram. </P>
              <P>There are a group of people in the poetry world that think that Rupi Kaur is lowering the standard of poetry. Actually, we were discussing Rupi Kaur in the office and we said that her poems on Instagram would be great if you’ve just been through a break up and you want to read something with a bucket of ice cream, I just see her as a break up poet.</P>

              <p>A lot of people on my Instagram take pictures of them reading her on the train and they get like 150 likes because people think ‘oh, you’re so cultured reading poetry’ but everyone who is a poet, working for no money, thinks that Rupi Kaur is only publishing her work for Instagram. And that’s definitely not what some poets think poetry is about. But you can’t doubt the success of people that are making it on Instagram either I suppose.”</p>

<p>Break up poet or pioneer, no one can argue with the numbers that Kaur has enticed into poetry. Almost single-handedly she has reimaged the exclusive notion that poetry once was and made the inaccessible the mainstream. Perhaps Instagram is poetry's future, rather than its downfall.</p>
